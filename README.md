Perfect — a **README** is a great idea for your app, especially if you plan to share the project with testers, collaborators, or even just for documentation when you come back to it. Since this is *My Time Matter*, a professional, concise README is best. I’ll draft one you can use as a template.

# 📄 My Time Matter — README

## Overview

**My Time Matter** is an iOS app for salary-exempt employees to track work activity and see their **true hourly equivalent**. Many professionals work beyond the standard 40-hour workweek, and this app helps them understand what their salary is really paying them for their time.

The app tracks activities such as:

* Office work
* Emails
* Phone calls
* After-hours tasks

It calculates your effective hourly rate and provides insights into how additional hours impact your compensation.
